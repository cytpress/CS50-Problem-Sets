For first question:
    Spotify must have their own data of the average energy, valence, and danceability.
    We just calculate the average of energy, valence, and danceability from users' top100.
    Then compare the data with Spotify's average, if the users' average energy is above 2 standard deviation from Spotify, we can assume that the user prefer fast-paced energetic songs, and so are valence and danceability.

For second question:
    Simple average might not be the best method in this case.
    Weighted time played should be considered because songs played more often should have greater impact.
    For example: the 100th played song may be played only once and it has the same influence as the 1st in the original method.

    Also, there are a huge variety of songs, only 3 metrics cannot determine what a users' preference, and people tends to listen to certain songs in certain situation. These are not considered in the Audio Aura method.
